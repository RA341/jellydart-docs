# Introduction

Welcome to the docs! The docs are divided into 2 section [Maintainer Docs](customdocs.mdx) written by the maintainers
of the project and [Auto generated docs](autogen.mdx) created by the OpenAPI generator.

## How to use this

Consider reading through the [**Maintainer docs**](customdocs.mdx) first as it will contain a quick overview of all the patched stuff that the
auto-generator got wrong.

While we will try our best to keep the docs accurate, the docs can sometimes be wrong, so use your best judgment when following the docs.

## Motivation

I am developing a Jellyfin client in flutter, so I generated this SDK using the openapi generator with the Jellyfin api spec.
Since the generator is not perfect, there are some things that need to be patched manually, hence the reason the docs are divided.

[Maintainer Docs](customdocs.mdx) - Contain docs about patched stuff, and any other quirks the Auto-generated sdk creates.

[Auto generated docs](autogen.mdx) - Contain docs generated from the Api spec. I don't want to mess with the autogenerated docs.

## Issues and contribution

If you think there is an issue with the SDK or a mistake in the docs, open an issue on the [main SDK repo](https://github.com/RA341/jellydart/issues).

If you can fix it open a pull request!!, contributions are always welcome.

## Disclaimer

This is an unofficial Jellyfin SDK, and I have no association with the Jellyfin team.
